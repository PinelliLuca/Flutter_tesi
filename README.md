## Flutter: interfacce grafiche innovative per dispositivi mobili

In my thesis titled 'Flutter: Innovative Graphic Interfaces for Mobile Devices,' I developed an experimental e-commerce application. This comprehensive application included various sections and features for viewing clothing items. Users had options for standard viewing modes, combination of garments, and a unique 3D visualization feature, implemented using the O3D library. This project offered a multifaceted approach to enhancing the user's shopping experience.
